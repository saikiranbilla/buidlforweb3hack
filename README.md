# Degree Tokenization
Degree Tokenization is a decentralized application built during the **BUIDL FOR WEB3 HACK hackathon** to solve the problem of degree forgery. This project enables colleges to issue degrees to students on the blockchain, making it tamper-proof and easily verifiable by recruiters.

## Soul-Based Tokens
The project uses soul-based tokens, a type of Non-Fungible Token (NFT), to represent each degree issued by the college. Each soul-based token is unique and cannot be duplicated, making it the perfect solution for representing the uniqueness of each degree. The use of soul-based tokens allows the degrees to be easily transferred and validated on the blockchain, ensuring that they are tamper-proof and verifiable by recruiters.

## Stakeholders
The application has three main stakeholders - colleges, students, and recruiters. The colleges will issue the degree to each student, and the student will claim it. The recruiters will validate the degree on the blockchain while recruiting the student for a job.

## Login
The login for the application is connected to the Metamask wallet, ensuring secure and decentralized access.

## Cross-chain Communication
The application uses **Router protocol** to facilitate cross-chain communication and make the degrees accessible across different blockchain networks. The Router protocol enables communication between multiple networks, allowing the degrees to be easily transferred and validated between different chains.

## Hosting
The application is hosted on the **Spheron** platform, providing a secure and reliable infrastructure for the application. Spheron is a decentralized hosting platform that uses IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to store and serve the web application's content. The use of Spheron ensures that the application is hosted on a decentralized, tamper-proof, and resilient network, providing a secure and reliable user experience. You can access the application at http://buidlforweb3hack-6d7b62.spheron.app/.
